					months, their valuations were, on average, 23% above precrisis levels, while the least
					digitally mature companies had managed just 7% growth, on average. Companies aiming to
					accelerate their digital transformation and create value should learn how the most

					efficiency, shareholder value, and top-line growth. We have identified four accelerators
					that are strongly tied to the ability of these companies to translate strategy into
